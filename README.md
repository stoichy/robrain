# RoBrain

**Shared memory across your team and your AI agents — with judgment about what's worth keeping.**

Most agent-memory tools stop at capture — they store what happened and hope you query it later. RoBrain is built around a different question: **what is worth keeping, and what should surface before the agent acts again?** Passive capture records every decision and the alternatives your team ruled out; batch **Synthesis** reads the whole corpus to flag contradictions, drift, and recurring entities that no single session could see.

> The cost of forgetting a rejection isn't inefficiency. It's the auth bypass you already patched, the migration you already rolled back, the dependency you already removed for a CVE — re-suggested by an agent with no memory of why you said no.

Open-source, self-hosted Postgres. Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot (VS Code), and Codex CLI**.

Coding is the first vertical because the feedback loops are tight — reverts, incidents, and rework make the cost of a forgotten rejection measurable. The same architecture applies wherever agents make decisions that outlast a session.

RoBrain is built by [Rory Plans](https://roryplans.ai), an agent orchestration platform; it is the memory and judgment layer that keeps multi-agent, multi-developer work coherent over time.

## How it works (short)

**Tuesday — experienced teammate in Cursor:** The team is shipping Perception as a small Hono server. They consider porting to Express so contributors have a familiar stack, but settle on Hono: it runs on Bun and edge runtimes without a rewrite, and the API is already Express-shaped (`app.get`, middleware chain). RoBrain captures the decision and the rejected Express path automatically — no one tags it as “worth remembering.”

**Wednesday — new teammate in Claude Code:** A fresh session has no memory of Tuesday. They ask whether Perception should move to Express — a reasonable question if you only see the repo today. With RoBrain wired in, the agent pulls the prior decision (<strong><span style="color:#6d4aa3">always-on summary</span></strong> at session start, or `npx robrain inject` for a focused pull) and pushes back with the recorded rationale: deliberate Hono choice, marginal familiarity upside, real cost in locking out edge deploy and churn on a working server. The team does not re-litigate from zero.

That is the handoff RoBrain is built for: **Cursor Tuesday → Claude Code Wednesday**, same Postgres store, same structured vetoes — captured passively, surfaced before the agent steers you down a path you already rejected.

## Two pillars

### Capture (reactive)

Sensing records session turns; Perception extracts decisions without the agent choosing what to remember. Every row can carry **`rejected[]`** — structured vetoes that are the substrate for pre-task warnings, not a marketing bullet on their own.

### Judgment (corpus-wide)

**Synthesis** runs three passes over the full `decisions` table: **drift** (stance moving without an explicit reversal), **contradictions** (pairs of incompatible decisions from different sessions), and **entity promotion** (recurring tools/patterns condensed into `planning_blocks`). Perception flags conflicts at write time; Synthesis catches what reactive capture missed. **`robrain review`** and the <strong><span style="color:#6d4aa3">always-on summary</span></strong> keep only what you trust.

That is what “judgment about what's worth keeping” looks like in code — not another grep over chat logs.

## What you get

- **Capture** decisions automatically — every turn classified, no agent involvement
- **Query** vetoes as structured `rejected[]` fields in Postgres
- **Catch** contradictions and drift across the corpus
- **Hand off** context across tools and developers
- **Explain** any file's history with `npx robrain explain`

## Compared to other memory tools

Versus **Mem0**, **Cloudflare Agent Memory**, and **Claude Code Auto-Memory**: only RoBrain stores rejected alternatives as structured fields and runs scheduled corpus-wide contradiction scans. **[Full comparison →](docs/concepts.md#comparisons)**

### Self-hosted vs Rory Plans cloud

| | Free / self-hosted | Rory Plans cloud |
|---|-------------------|------------------|
| Capture + `rejected[]` + Synthesis + review | ✓ | ✓ |
| Data stays on your machine | ✓ | processed remotely |
| <strong><span style="color:#6d4aa3">Always-on summary</span></strong> at session start | ✓ | ✓ |
| Automatic injection + rejection warnings at task boundaries | — | ✓ |

Self-hosted gives capture, judgment batch jobs, and session-start recall; you pull focused context with `inject` when needed. Cloud adds Planning + Control so vetoes and conflicts surface before the agent acts.

## Quick start — self-hosted

From a fresh clone, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` plus one embedding-provider key (or set `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` for OpenAI-only — see [Concepts](docs/concepts.md#prefer-not-to-use-anthropic-run-openai-only)), then run:

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm docker:up
```

These first three commands run once from the `robrain` clone.

```bash
npm install -g robrain
npx robrain install --self-hosted --repo-root "$(pwd)"
```

These commands install the RoBrain package and wire Sensing MCP into your editors.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project && npx robrain init-project
```

The last command runs once per application repo.

**Next:** [CLI reference — Install and setup](docs/cli.md#install-and-setup) · [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md) if captures do not land.

---

## Run Synthesis

Synthesis writes contradiction flags, drift signals, and entity summaries into your DB (`planning_blocks`, relation edges). Review what it finds with **`robrain review`** — it does not capture new decisions; it judges the corpus you already have.

```bash
pnpm synthesis:build && pnpm synthesis:run
# or: npx robrain synth
```

Deep dive (three passes, cron, env vars): **[Concepts — Synthesis](docs/concepts.md#synthesis)**.

## What's next

Connecting decisions to outcomes (reverts, incidents, cycle time) so RoBrain can surface when a team is optimizing for the wrong thing in its own codebase.
