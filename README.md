# RoBrain

[![VetoBench](https://img.shields.io/badge/VetoBench-0%2F50_violations_·_receipts_in--repo-2ea44f)](#vetobench)

**Shared memory across your team and your AI agents — with judgment!**

RoBrain isn't just another memory layer — it's the brain that helps you and your agents make better decisions and avoid costly mistakes.

Self-hosted on your own Postgres. Passive capture, structured vetoes, corpus-wide contradiction scans — nothing leaves your machine. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot (VS Code), Codex CLI, Hermes and more.

Measured: without decision memory, a coding agent re-proposes an approach your team already rejected in up to **9 of 10** tasks. Through RoBrain's full pipeline: **0 of 50**, across five archived runs — [VetoBench](#vetobench).

## What it is

RoBrain records what your team and its agents decide — and the alternatives they ruled out — without anyone tagging anything by hand. Sensing captures session turns; Perception extracts each decision into Postgres, where every row can carry a structured `rejected[]` field.

Most agent-memory tools stop at capture: they store what happened and hope you query it later. RoBrain adds judgment. Batch **Synthesis** reads the whole corpus to flag contradictions, stance drift, and recurring entities that no single session could see.

The point is the handoff. Someone makes a deliberate call in Cursor on Tuesday — say, keeping Perception on Hono instead of porting to Express. A new teammate opens Claude Code on Wednesday with no memory of it and asks to make exactly that change. RoBrain surfaces the recorded rationale before the agent steers down a path you already rejected — same Postgres store, same vetoes, captured passively.

> The cost of forgetting a rejection isn't inefficiency. It's the auth bypass you already patched, the migration you already rolled back, the dependency you already removed for a CVE — re-suggested by an agent with no memory of why you said no.

Coding is the first vertical because the feedback loops are tight — reverts, incidents, and rework make the cost of a forgotten rejection measurable. The same architecture applies wherever agents make decisions that outlast a session.

How it works, the two pillars (capture + judgment), and the full walkthrough: [docs/concepts.md](docs/concepts.md#how-it-works).

## Install

No clone needed — `robrain up` pulls the published Perception image and generates credentials into `~/.robrain/stack/.env`:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=...   # or add them to ~/.robrain/stack/.env after the first run
npx robrain@latest up                             # start Postgres + Perception from ghcr.io
npx robrain install --self-hosted                 # wire Sensing MCP into your editors
```

<details>
<summary>From a clone instead (development, or building the image yourself)</summary>

First `pnpm docker:up` auto-creates `.env` and fills `PERCEPTION_API_KEY` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Perception still needs your LLM + embedding keys before it stays up.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain
cd robrain
pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm docker:up                 # first run: creates .env; Perception won't start yet
# open .env, add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY + your embedding key (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY)
pnpm docker:up                 # second run: Perception now boots
npx robrain install --self-hosted --repo-root "$(pwd)"
```

</details>

### Claude Code plugin

Claude Code users can add hook-based capture and pre-task warnings about previously rejected approaches — no CLAUDE.md protocol needed:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add adelinamart/robrain
claude plugin install robrain@robrain
```

Details: [plugins/claude-code](plugins/claude-code/README.md). `robrain init-project` also recommends the plugin to collaborators via the project's `.claude/settings.json`, so teammates get an install prompt from Claude Code itself (opt out with `--skip-claude-plugin`).

OpenAI-only: set `LLM_PROVIDER=openai` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` instead of Anthropic — see [Concepts — Prefer not to use Anthropic](docs/concepts.md#prefer-not-to-use-anthropic-run-openai-only).

Upgrading on a new release — no-clone stack: just re-run `npx robrain@latest up`. From a clone: `git pull` → `pnpm install && pnpm build` → `pnpm docker:up:build` → `npx robrain install --self-hosted --repo-root "$(pwd)"` → fully restart editors. Full checklist: [CLI reference — Upgrading](docs/cli.md#upgrading).

## Quickstart

```bash
# Wire capture into an application project (run inside the repo)
cd /path/to/your/project
npx robrain init-project          # writes CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, .cursor/rules/robrain.mdc

# Capture and recall are automatic from here:
#   - every session turn is classified, no tagging
#   - prior decisions load at session start via the always-on summary

# Explain any file's decision history
npx robrain explain path/to/file

# Run corpus judgment (manual, or add to cron)
npx robrain synth                 # drift, contradictions, entity promotion
npx robrain review                # inspect / approve captured rows
```

After `init-project`, every repo gets `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` (Codex CLI), and Cursor also gets `.cursor/rules/robrain.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true`. If captures don't land, run `npx robrain doctor` — see [Troubleshooting](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Synthesis

Synthesis runs three passes over the full `decisions` table — **drift** (stance moving without an explicit reversal), **contradictions** (incompatible decisions from different sessions), and **entity promotion** (recurring tools/patterns condensed into `planning_blocks`). It writes flags and edges into your DB; it does not capture new decisions — it judges the corpus you already have.

```bash
pnpm synthesis:build && pnpm synthesis:run
# or: npx robrain synth
```

Review what it finds with `npx robrain review`. Deep dive (three passes, cron, env vars): [Concepts — Synthesis](docs/concepts.md#synthesis).

## Editor integration

One cross-tool setup covers **Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot (VS Code), and Codex CLI** against the same Postgres store. The classifier LLM is your choice — Anthropic Haiku or OpenAI. Decisions carry a lifecycle (active / superseded / invalidated) and a graph (`conflicts_with` / `extends` / `related_to`).

**Codex CLI / IDE** also gets hook-based capture and pre-task veto warnings — the same lifecycle hooks as the Claude Code plugin, wired automatically by `robrain install` into `~/.codex/config.toml` (Codex asks you to trust them on first run). Docs: [plugins/codex](plugins/codex/README.md).

Running [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent)? `npx robrain install --hermes` drops a standalone memory-provider plugin into `~/.hermes/plugins/` — passive capture and veto-aware recall through the same Perception API. Docs: [integrations/hermes](integrations/hermes/robrain/README.md).

Decision ledger for git (opt-in):

```bash
npx robrain export-memory --ledger
# custom path: npx robrain export-memory --ledger docs/decisions.md
```

## Compared to other tools

Versus **Mem0**, **Cloudflare Agent Memory**, and **Claude Code Auto-Memory**: only RoBrain stores rejected alternatives as structured fields and runs corpus-wide contradiction scans (manual or cron). And we measured what that difference costs: [VetoBench](#vetobench) found Mem0's ingestion dropped the recorded rejection from **38% of retrieved contexts** on identical input.

## VetoBench

Memory benchmarks usually ask "did the right item come back?" [VetoBench](packages/vetobench/README.md) asks what that misses: **given a task that invites an approach the team already rejected, does the agent propose it again?**

| Memory condition | Re-proposed a rejected approach | Could cite the prior rejection |
|---|---|---|
| No memory | 8–9 of 10 tasks | 0–10% |
| Conventions file (choices only — what most teams have today) | 1–2 of 10 | 80–90%, but inferred: the reasons aren't there |
| Mem0 — full pipeline, 5 archived runs | 0–2 of 10 per run | 50–90% |
| **RoBrain — full pipeline, 5 archived runs** | **0 of 10, every run** | **100%** |

(claude-haiku-4-5, 2026-07-07/08; every condition measured as a five-run archived series, ranges because runs vary. Mem0 and RoBrain ingested **byte-identical transcripts**, each through its own real production extraction.)

Two findings behind the table. Mem0's ingestion dropped the recorded rejection from **38% of retrieved contexts**, and violations concentrated exactly there — 26% when the veto was absent vs 3% when present: the agent avoided Express in all five runs but could never say why, and where the axios veto was lost it re-proposed axios outright in 3 of 5 runs. RoBrain's production extractor, on the same input, kept **100/100 vetoes** — keeping the veto is the extraction prompt's job, not a side effect of fact summarization.

**Exploratory: Meta Muse Spark 1.1 (2026-07-13).** First live runs against Meta's newly launched agentic flagship, via Vercel AI Gateway. Without memory it re-proposed rejected approaches in **6 of 8** completed scenarios (Redux, Prisma, Jest, CSS-in-JS, drizzle-kit, GraphQL); with RoBrain retrieval, **0 of 9** — naming the prior rejection every time. The cleanest cell: asked to cut mobile overfetching, the no-memory run proposed a full GraphQL rollout (the approach the team had ruled out); with RoBrain in context it proposed REST sparse fieldsets and cited the recorded rejection, reason and date included. Not yet a quotable series — free-tier rate limits split the runs, one scenario never completed, and one is excluded because Meta's content filter deterministically blocks a benign session-caching prompt. Receipts and full caveats: [results/muse-spark-1.1-series/](packages/vetobench/results/muse-spark-1.1-series/).

Every retrieved context, agent reply, and verdict is committed in [packages/vetobench/results/](packages/vetobench/results/) — check the work before quoting it. The retrieval layer runs offline with no API key and gates CI (`pnpm --filter @robrain/vetobench bench`); judging is deterministic — no LLM judge. Any memory system plugs in through one adapter interface; PRs welcome, including ones that make us look bad. Methodology, honesty caveats, and fixtures: [packages/vetobench/README.md](packages/vetobench/README.md).

## Security

The memory corpus is guarded by `PERCEPTION_API_KEY` — a random secret in the repo-root `.env` that every client (Sensing MCP, CLI, Synthesis) sends as a Bearer token and Perception verifies on every request except `/health`. It is not issued by any service: `pnpm docker:up` generates one automatically on first run, or set your own (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`). `npx robrain install --self-hosted` copies the same value into your editor configs so clients authenticate.

Perception refuses to start when the key is empty — running unauthenticated requires an explicit opt-in. **Upgrading from a version that ran without a key:** add one to `.env` (or re-run `pnpm docker:up` to auto-fill it), then re-run `npx robrain install --self-hosted` so editors pick it up. Details and the opt-in flag are documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

Also on by default: secrets redaction (API keys, tokens, private keys, connection-string passwords are scrubbed at capture and again at ingest, before anything is embedded or stored), and a fully-local mode where extraction and embeddings run on an OpenAI-compatible local server — see [`.env.example`](.env.example).

## What's next

`robrain outcomes` feeds git reverts back into memory quality on both tiers; next is widening that to incidents and cycle time, so RoBrain can surface when a team is optimizing for the wrong thing in its own codebase.

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose (runs Postgres and Perception locally)
- Node.js with pnpm (build and CLI)
- An LLM key for the classifier — Anthropic Haiku or OpenAI
- An embedding key (e.g. OpenAI)
- No data leaves your machine in self-hosted mode
