## Troubleshooting

After setup, Sensing runs automatically whenever Claude Code is open. The MCP server is registered in `~/.claude/mcp.json`, so Claude Code starts it automatically on launch. The `CLAUDE.md` instructions tell Claude to call `sensing_start_session` at the beginning of each session and `sensing_record_turn` after every exchange.

**The one thing that can break it:**

Claude Code doesn't always follow `CLAUDE.md` instructions reliably — this is the compliance problem from pre-launch testing. If Claude stops calling `sensing_record_turn`, Sensing goes silent. The way to check:

```bash
npx robrain status
```

That prints Perception connectivity and a **`Decisions:`** count for the current project (from **`GET /projects`**). If **`Decisions: 0`** after a session where you expected captures, Claude may not have called the Sensing tools, or Perception rejected writes — run **`npx robrain review`** to confirm what is stored. The fix is often to make `CLAUDE.md` more explicit or remind Claude: *"follow the RoBrain instructions in CLAUDE.md."*

**The practical reality:**

The developer needs two habits:
- `npx robrain review` after sessions where important decisions were made
- `npx robrain inject --copy` before starting a new task that builds on prior work

Everything else — capture, extraction, storage, embedding — happens without you doing anything.

### Decisions captured in the editor but `robrain review` shows nothing (silent 401)

The most common silent failure: the editor's MCP panel shows Sensing as connected, you made decisions in chats, but `robrain review --history` or a direct DB query returns nothing. Perception is rejecting every signal with **401 Unauthorized** and Sensing has no way to surface that back to the editor.

**1. Check the API key wired into the MCP env:**

```bash
grep PERCEPTION_API_KEY ~/.cursor/mcp.json          # Cursor
grep PERCEPTION_API_KEY ~/.claude.json | head       # Claude Code
grep PERCEPTION_API_KEY ~/.codex/config.toml        # Codex CLI
```

If you see `"PERCEPTION_API_KEY": ""`, that's the bug. Versions of `robrain` **< 0.4.0** wrote it as empty even when `.env` had a key. Upgrade and reinstall:

```bash
npm install -g robrain@latest          # global install
# — or from a clone of the repo —
pnpm install:self-hosted
```

**2. Inspect Sensing MCP's stderr — the only place 401s surface:**

```bash
# Cursor — tail the Sensing MCP stderr from the most recent log dir
LATEST=$(ls -td ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/logs/*/ | head -1)
find "$LATEST" -name "MCP user-robrain-sensing.log" -exec tail -30 {} \;
```

Look for `[Sensing] Perception API error: 401` or `always-on summary fetch failed: 401`. If you see them, the key in the editor's MCP env doesn't match Perception's `PERCEPTION_API_KEY`.

**3. Fully restart the editor — closing the chat is not enough.**

Cursor and Claude Code cache the spawned MCP **child process** with its initial env. Closing a chat or window keeps that child alive with the old (empty) env. Use **`Cmd-Q`** on the editor entirely, then reopen.

### Verifying a decision actually landed

```bash
# Compute your project_id (deterministic 12-char hash of the absolute repo path)
echo -n "/absolute/path/to/your/repo" | shasum -a 256 | awk '{print substr($1,1,12)}'

# Direct DB query — substitute <project_id>
docker exec -i robrain-postgres psql -U robrain -d robrain -c \
  "SELECT created_at, decision, rejected
   FROM context_system.decisions
   WHERE project_id='<project_id>' AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '15 minutes'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;"

# Or via Perception API (Authorization required)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <PERCEPTION_API_KEY>" \
  "http://localhost:3001/decisions?project_id=<project_id>&history=true&limit=20"
```

### Decision is in the DB but the next session doesn't surface it

The always-on summary is **cached on the project row**. Fresh decisions normally trigger regeneration, but a missed regen leaves the cache stale. Force one:

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <PERCEPTION_API_KEY>" \
  "http://localhost:3001/projects/<project_id>/regenerate-summary"
```

Then start a **new** Claude Code / Cursor session so `sensing_start_session` pulls the regenerated summary.

### Perception container unhealthy or refusing to start

```bash
docker ps | grep robrain-perception
docker inspect robrain-perception --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'
docker logs --tail=80 robrain-perception
```

If Perception logs `Refusing to start: PERCEPTION_API_KEY is empty`, put a key in `<repo-root>/.env`:

```bash
PERCEPTION_API_KEY=<any-long-random-string>
```

Then rebuild:

```bash
pnpm docker:up:build
```

The CLI installer (0.4.0+) reads the **same** `.env`, so client and server stay in sync automatically. Run `pnpm install:self-hosted` (or `robrain install --self-hosted --repo-root /path/to/clone`) to propagate the key into editor MCP configs, then fully restart Cursor / Claude Code.

### Stale Perception Docker image (migrations / schema out of sync)

If you **pulled new code** but did **not rebuild** the `perception` service, the container may still run an **older** Perception binary than `packages/perception-self-hosted` on disk. Then startup migrations (for example `reviewed_at` on `decisions`) never run, `robrain review` approval can fail against the DB the CLI is using, and features that assume the new schema break in confusing ways.

From the **repo root** (same directory as `.env` and `docker/docker-compose.yml`):

```bash
pnpm docker:up:build
```

That runs **`prepare-env`** and **`docker compose … up -d --build perception`** — rebuilds the Perception image and recreates the container.

To **build only**, then start Perception yourself:

```bash
pnpm docker:build
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up -d perception
```

If Docker reused layers and you still see old behavior, force a clean rebuild (no pnpm shortcut for **`--no-cache`** yet):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env build --no-cache perception
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up -d perception
```

Sanity check:

```bash
curl -sf "http://localhost:${PERCEPTION_PORT:-3001}/health"
```

**After shared types change** (`packages/shared`): downstream packages read **`@robrain/shared` types from `dist/`**. From repo root run **`pnpm --filter @robrain/shared build`** (or **`pnpm -r build`**) before relying on **`pnpm typecheck`** or publishing — otherwise `packages/*/dist/*.d.ts` can lag **`packages/shared/src`**.

**Verify the running container matches your checkout:** tail Perception logs while exercising capture — you should see current behavior (for example embedding dedupe logs as **`POST /signals deduped`** with matched decision text when a near-duplicate is skipped):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f --tail=80 perception
```

**Note:** A **brand-new** Postgres volume applies `packages/shared/schema.sql` on first boot. **Existing** volumes rely on Perception’s **idempotent startup migrations** when you run an up-to-date image — so after upgrading, rebuild and restart `perception` once.
