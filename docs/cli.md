# CLI reference

Install details, editor setup, and the full command table.

[← Back to README](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain)

## Install and setup

`pnpm docker:up` brings up Postgres + Perception in the background; the user-facing surfaces are Sensing and the `robrain` CLI. `npx robrain init-project` writes the project instructions that tell each editor's agent to call the Sensing tools at session start and end (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` for Codex, and `.cursor/rules/robrain.mdc` when Cursor is installed).

Self-hosted setup usually needs two keys: **`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`** for extraction and one embedding-provider key for semantic retrieval. If that surprises you, see [Why are there two API keys in self-hosted mode?](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain/blob/main/docs/concepts.md#why-are-there-two-api-keys-in-self-hosted-mode).

#### Prerequisites
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node.js **18.18+** (older 18.x + npm 9.6 can break `npx` bin permissions; upgrade Node or use `pnpm dlx robrain`), pnpm
- Anthropic API key (for Haiku extraction)
- OpenAI, Voyage, or Cohere API key (for embeddings)

#### Repo setup and `.env`

From the repository root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain
cd robrain
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` at the repo root (the same keys power Perception in Docker and the CLI install prompts). Paste real keys from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com) and your embedding provider — do not commit that file.

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

Keep `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` identical between this file and what you select when running install (or set `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` in `.env` and install will pick it up without prompting).

#### What `init-project` writes

`robrain init-project` writes mode-aware instructions:

- **Free / self-hosted** (`robrain install --self-hosted`): generated `CLAUDE.md` / Cursor rule / `AGENTS.md` (Codex) uses only `sensing_*` tools.
- **Cloud / Control-enabled**: generated instructions include both `sensing_*` and `control_*` calls.

`init-project` always writes the same managed RoBrain block into `AGENTS.md` at the project root (for Codex CLI and any tool that reads AGENTS.md). If Codex CLI is installed (`~/.codex/`), `robrain install` also registers `robrain-sensing` in `~/.codex/config.toml` (use `--editor codex` to configure Codex only).

#### CLI on your `PATH` (optional)

If you prefer not to use `npx` every time, install the package globally, then use the `robrain` command directly:

```bash
npm install -g robrain
```

Open a **new** terminal, or in zsh run `rehash` so your shell picks up the new binary. Then:

```bash
robrain install --self-hosted
# …and the same for other commands: robrain init-project, robrain review, etc.
```

If you get `command not found: robrain`, either use `npx robrain …` or ensure your global npm `bin` directory is on your `PATH` (see `npm prefix -g`).

#### Cursor-specific setup (most reliable path)

`robrain init-project` automatically writes `.cursor/rules/robrain.mdc` with
`alwaysApply: true`, so Cursor loads the RoBrain session-lifecycle instructions
every session. No copy-paste step is required.

To verify:

```bash
cat .cursor/rules/robrain.mdc
```

**If decisions stop landing:** the rule file is present, but Cursor's agent
sometimes ignores rule content turn-to-turn. Check the Cursor MCP panel for the
`robrain-sensing` server status, then see
[Decisions captured in the editor but `robrain review` shows nothing](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#decisions-captured-in-the-editor-but-robrain-review-shows-nothing-silent-401).

Adding more rules will not fix a compliance gap. That is a Cursor-side behavior
that Rory Plans cloud layers additional safeguards against (see
[Free / self-hosted vs Rory Plans cloud](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain/blob/main/docs/concepts.md#free--self-hosted-vs-rory-plans-cloud)).

### Codex CLI setup

`robrain install` (or `robrain install --editor codex`) writes a marker-bounded
`robrain-sensing` block into `~/.codex/config.toml`. `init-project` always updates
`AGENTS.md` at the project root with the same session-lifecycle instructions as
`CLAUDE.md`.

To verify:

```bash
grep -A2 'robrain-sensing' ~/.codex/config.toml
grep 'project_id=' AGENTS.md
codex mcp list   # optional — confirm robrain-sensing is enabled
```

Restart the Codex CLI session after install so it reloads MCP config. If captures
stop landing, check `PERCEPTION_API_KEY` in the managed block (see [troubleshooting](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md)) and confirm the agent is following the RoBrain section in `AGENTS.md`.

## Upgrading

When a new RoBrain release is out, update every layer you installed: the **git clone** (CLI + Sensing MCP), the **Perception Docker image**, and **editor MCP configs**. Your Postgres data and repo-root `.env` stay in place — you are not reinstalling from scratch.

Check what you are running: `npx robrain --version` (or the `version` field in the clone’s root `package.json`). Compare with [GitHub — Releases](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain/releases) or the latest `main` branch.

### Self-hosted from a clone (typical)

From the **robrain repo root** (same directory as `docker/` and `.env`):

```bash
git pull
pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm docker:up:build
npx robrain install --self-hosted --repo-root "$(pwd)"
```

| Step | Why it matters |
|------|----------------|
| `git pull` + `pnpm build` | Picks up CLI, Sensing MCP, and shared package changes |
| `pnpm docker:up:build` | Rebuilds Perception and applies startup DB migrations — **pulling code alone leaves the old container running** |
| `robrain install --self-hosted` | Refreshes MCP server paths and env in Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and Copilot |
| **Fully quit and reopen editors** | Closing a chat does not reload the MCP child process or its environment (`Cmd-Q` on macOS, then reopen) |

Application repos usually **do not** need `init-project` again. Re-run it only if release notes call out changes to `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.cursor/rules/robrain.mdc`.

More detail on stale containers and schema drift: [Troubleshooting — Stale Perception Docker image](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#stale-perception-docker-image-migrations--schema-out-of-sync).

### Global CLI (`npm install -g robrain`)

```bash
npm install -g robrain@latest
```

That updates the CLI on your PATH only. **Self-hosted Docker still requires the clone steps above** — Perception and `ROBRAIN_REPO` live in the repo, not in the global package.

```bash
cd /path/to/robrain
git pull && pnpm install && pnpm build
pnpm docker:up:build
npx robrain install --self-hosted --repo-root "$(pwd)"
```

### Verify after upgrading

```bash
curl -sf "http://localhost:${PERCEPTION_PORT:-3001}/health"
npx robrain status
```

If captures or review behave oddly after an upgrade, see [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Why does this code exist?

The judgment layer pays off when you need file-scoped history — decisions plus vetoes, not just “we use Zustand”:

```bash
$ npx robrain explain src/store/cart.ts

  src/store/cart.ts — 3 decisions

  • Chose Zustand over Redux (re-render performance issues in cart) — Mar 15 2024
  • Chose optimistic updates over server-confirmed writes (felt slow to users) — Apr 2 2024
  • Chose normalised shape over nested objects — Apr 18 2024

  Tip: add --why for full rationale and rejected alternatives
```

With `--why` for the full picture:

```bash
$ npx robrain explain src/store/cart.ts --why

  src/store/cart.ts — 3 decisions

  Mar 15 2024  Use Zustand for state management
               because: Redux caused re-render performance issues in cart
               rejected: Redux (re-render perf), MobX (team unfamiliar)

  Apr 2 2024   Chose optimistic updates
               because: server-confirmed felt slow to users
               rejected: pessimistic updates (bad UX on slow connections)

  Apr 18 2024  Chose normalised shape over nested objects
               because: query performance at scale
```

Works on files, directories, or any path RoBrain has seen in a session. With Synthesis-fed `planning_blocks`, the same command can surface topic-level truth and cross-corpus conflicts the reactive path never linked.

## CLI commands

All commands accept `--help` for full flag details. Repo-level `pnpm` scripts live in `package.json`; CLI commands live in `packages/cli`.

| `pnpm synthesis:run` | **[Synthesis](https://github.com/adelinamart/robrain/blob/main/docs/concepts.md#synthesis)** — batch job from **robrain repo root** (`pnpm` must resolve `@robrain/synthesis`) |
| `npx robrain synth` | Same job via CLI: optional **`--dry-run`**, **`--full`**, **`--lookback <n>`**, **`--project <id>`**. Resolves the robrain monorepo from this CLI package unless **`ROBRAIN_REPO`** is set (needed for some global installs). |
